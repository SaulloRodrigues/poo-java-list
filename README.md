# Task List - Object-Oriented Programming in Java
This project is an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Task List** built in **Java**. It demonstrates key OOP principles such as **encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**, while also exploring **class relationships** and interactions. The system models a structured task management application, showcasing how objects communicate and collaborate effectively.

This project was developed as part of my studies at **Universidade Christus**.
